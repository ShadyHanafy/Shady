## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb dataset to better understand:

1. The most booked Seattle neighborhoods using listing descriptions
2. What factors affect the above behavior?
3. What factors affect the price of the neighborhood booking?
4. What might influence reviewer rating?
5. What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? and its reflection on prices?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 3 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

1. Property_booking.ipynb : Explore the listing dataset and understand the customers
2. Seattle Busiest Time.ipynb : Find the busiest time of the year in seattle and its reflection on prices
3. Price_Predict.ipynb : Model to try to predict the prices

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://github.com/ShadyHanafy/Shady/blob/main/Project%20Details.md).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Airbnb for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data).
